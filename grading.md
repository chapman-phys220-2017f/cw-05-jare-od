1. Nicely done!
1. For your sampling plot of the Lorentzian, it's a nice idea to truncate the distribution to avoid the problems with the tail. However, this procedure "renormalizes" the distribution, which is why the center of the estimate is much larger than the theoretical distribution. For a proper comparison of the truncated case, you should divide the theoretical Lorentzian by the integral of that function between the truncated domain boundaries.
