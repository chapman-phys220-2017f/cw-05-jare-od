# PHYS220 CW 5

**Author(s):** **Jarod Penniman and Jared Love**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2017f/cw-05-jare-od.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2017f/cw-05-jare-od)

## Specification

1. With your partner, go through and complete the notebook `cw05.ipynb`. This notebook will demonstrate the implementation of useful functions, and how to plot them using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
1. With any extra time, create a new notebook `plots.ipynb` and implement a few of the more interesting exercises from the following `matplotlib` tutorial for practice : https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

We liked the emphasis on plotting functions and showing all of the customizable features when using matplotlib.  You really have a lot of control in making your graphs exactly how you want them to look.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
- Borrowed code regarding 3D plots in matplotlib as well as how to deal with the Caushy sampling for the Lorentzian.

Signed,

**Jarod Penniman and Jared Love**
